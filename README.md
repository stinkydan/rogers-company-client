# Roger's Landscaping LLC

This is a freelance project I am currently working on to improve the efficiency of Roger's Landscaping LLC.  It consists of several pages of company information, quoting tools, scheduling tools, and an online payment option (through the use of Stripe).

## Quoting Tools

You can find the quoting tools by clicking on 'Get Quote' in the top nav.  Once there, you'll find a Google Map containing an Autocomplete input.  When an address is entered, the map will zoom in to the requested address and switch to satellite view.  A user can then draw a polygon by clicking points on the map around the vegetation in question.  The area between these points is calculated and stored in state when the polygon has been completed.

When the map portion has been completed, a user will be prompted to enter the type of job they want completed and basic contact information. They can click the 'Get Quote' button and, voila- an accurate quote appears within seconds!
